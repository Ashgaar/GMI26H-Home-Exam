There will be no (extensive) mathematics in the home exam, apart from perhaps a short formula here or there, but understanding the basics of the mathematics behind cryptography will surely improve your general understanding of the algorithms.

    "Stallings, W. (2022) details how the playfair cipher works so I will follow the book on how to do this. First we generate the square using the keyword \"dalarna\", $\\begin{matrix}D & A & L & R & N\\\\B & C & E & F & G\\\\H & I & K & M & O\\\\P & Q & S & T & U\\\\V & W & X & Y & Z\\\\\\end{matrix}$. We then divide the plaintext into pairs, \"ja\" \"me\" \"sb\" \"on\" \"dl\" \"iv\" \"ea\" \"nd\" \"le\" \"td\" \"ie\", we have no pairs with repeating letters which means that we don't have to add any fillers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The rules detailed in Stallings(2022) state that 2. if two letters in the pair are in the same row then they are replaced with the letter to the right 3. if the two letters in the pair are in the same column then the letter is replaced by the letter beneath. 4. if none of the above were true then the two letters in the a pair are replaced by the letter that lies in its own row but in the column of the other letter. So for example for the last one, \"ct\" becomes \"fq\".\n",

    "We can now look at the first pair \"ja\", where j would be i in our case. This would follow rule 3, \"j\" would become \"q\" and \"a\" would become \"c\", \"ja\" would therefore become \"qc\". Second pair is \"me\", we apply the 4th rule. \"m\" we go on the same row to the letter in the same column as \"e\" which is \"k\", we do the same for \"e\" which becomes \"f\", this forms \"kf\". The fifth pair \"dl\" have letters in the same row, \"d\" becomes \"a\" and \"l\" becomes \"r\".

This is where you analyze the frequency of the letters in the ciphertext and compare it to the frequency of the letters in the english language, in simple substitution ciphers if the frequency of an unusual letter like \"z\" appears as often as \"a\" then that would imply that \"z\" might have been substituted with \"a\". If we then look at the ciphertext \"svnyieakeeeklmtrnrheteetfvtnslvnioeesotws\", we can count the letters which leads to a = 1, e = 9, f = 1, h = 1, i = 2, k = 2, l = 2, m = 1, n = 4, o = 2, r = 2, s = 4, t = 5, v = 3, w = 1, y = 1 and the rest not mentioned are 0.

    "## Alan Turing’s contributions to cryptography and cryptanalysis\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Alan Turing, regarded as the “father of modern computing” (Tucker, 2022), was a British mathematician who contributed immensely to the fields of mathematics and cryptanalysis and helped create the foundation for fields like computer science and artificial intelligence. In the second world war, Turing played an integral part in breaking the enigma machine which was used by the Germans to encrypt messages. For this he was later awarded by being given the title of OBE. An award given to people for being known nationally in a field of expertise (Gov.uk, n.d.). His contributions to computing were significant as Turing created and input-output system, programming system and a programming manual for the first marketable electronic computer (Copeland, 2022). This essay will focus on his contributions to the field of cryptography, more specifically cryptanalysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "The enigma machine was a device that utilized a substitution cipher to encrypt commercial, diplomatic and military communications. The machine was capable of both encryption and decryption if they have the same key, which in this case is the same as the machine settings. This would therefore qualify as symmetric encryption; security was provided by changing the machine settings regularly. This means that the machine that is decrypting a message must be configured the same as the machine was that encrypted it (“Enigma machine”, 2022). Turing and Gordon Welchman developed a machine called Bombe, which was used to break Enigma-enciphered messages during the second world war. Since the Germans were changing settings daily, it was integral to find out what these settings were so that the messages could be deciphered in time. The machine allowed the British to find the key, which is the settings for the machine, within hours of receiving a message (The national computing of computing, n.d.). \n",
    "\n",
    "The word “cribs” is used to describe any known or suspected plaintext that is commonly occurring. One attack vector is therefore a known plaintext-attack, where the attacker knows part of the words, in the plaintext, or the whole plaintext. This was used by the cryptanalysts, which Turing was amongst, to break the Enigma. They realized that the Germans would regularly send weather reports and a commonly used phrase was “Nothing to report” (101 computing, 2019). Once a crib had been found they were able to brute force the key using Bombe, this combination of developing Bombe and the usage of cribs was largely attributed to Turing. Bombe acted like 36 Enigma machines and went through every possible setting, every combination was checked using the Bombe’s comparator unit and if no logical contradiction was found, then those settings were written down as a potential candidate (Ludlow, 2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "Turingery, also called Turing’s method, was a method developed by Turing which made it possible to figure out how a cipher machine was constructed using the keys used to encrypt and decrypt messages (“Turingery”, 2022). This method was utilized in breaking the SZ40,\n",
    "the Lorenz SZ40 was a German developed rotor stream cipher machine that was used by Germany during the second world war, Lorenz was used for transmitting at the highest level of German command (“Lorenz cipher”, 2022). The Lorenz machine utilized a much more sophisticated cipher and was a lot harder to break, William Tutte managed to figure out the inner workings of the machine without ever seeing it. Sometimes two messages would be transmitted using the same key, it was therefore possible to extract the keys and use that to figure out how the machine worked. This is due to the Turingery method (Zitarelli, 2015). \n",
    "\n",
    "Cryptography goes back to ancient times, but it has evolved especially in the modern age with the computational power we have today. What might have taken days could be brute forced in minutes. This can be attributed to Turing’s contribution as he laid the foundation for computing and allowed everyone to have the power of a computer (Tresorit team, 2022). This pushed cryptography to become more advanced as computers were sophisticated enough and powerful enough to brute force and perform calculations much faster than a human. Turing published a paper titled “can machines think?” in 1950, he detailed a way to test if a machine is truly thinking called the “Turing test”. Turing, along with Alonzo Chruch, came up with the Church-Turing thesis which states that there are mathematical problems that can’t be computed (Aron, J; n.d.). This essentially means there’s a limit to computational power (L. Casti, Calude, n.d.). \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these contributions to the scientific field of mathematics, cryptanalysis and creating the foundation for computer science, and his great contributions to the war effort through breaking the Enigma, Turing met an early end as in 1952 he was convicted for being a homosexual and was sentenced to be undergo hormone treatment for 12 months. In 1954 he was found dead; the official cause of death was ruled a suicide by cyanide poisoning. He broke the Enigma, and he devised a method that broke the Lorenz machine, saving countless of lives in the process. In 2013 Turing was pardoned and in 2019 he was voted the “greatest person of the 20th century”, that is the legacy of Alan Turing and his impact on cryptography and the world.

The two parties should now have the same key which they can use to encrypt and decrypt messages between eachother. Even if someone listens to the exchange of keys they can only get the mixed keys and the common public key and from this information it can be very hard to figure out the private keys. The reason for why it's a popular system is because the two parties can now send encrypted messages and it is not easy to get the key to decrypt those messages.

One of the reasons why this principle is good to follow is because it is easier to maintain the security of the system, if an intruder manages to get their hands on the key, then instead of changing major parts of the system you can just change the key. The key is another big reason as to why this principle is good, the less you need to keep secret the easier it would hopefully be. So instead of having to keep major parts of a system secret you only need to keep the key a secret."
